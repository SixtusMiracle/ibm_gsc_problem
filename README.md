The Great Sand Council (GSC) of the planet Phleebutt (apologies to Sierra) have devised a base 3 number system to suit their physiology. The symbols used to represent the three valid digits of their number system are o.1, and following the unusual configuration of their "hands' (don't ask). The decimal counterparts of the three symbols are, respectively, 0, 1 and
-1.

Each position in a number has a value three times greater than the position immediately to its right. For example, the number '10-' has the value 8 in decimal, since 199 + 0*3+ -101 = 8. Similarly, the number -1' has the decimal value-2, since -13 + 1 = -2.

You have to write a program that can convert 32-bit signed decimal integers into their equivalent Great Sand Council (GSC) representations.

#### Sample Input
Your program will receive a list of integers as input, for example:<br>
10<br> 2<br> -17<br> 42<br> 1024<br>

#### Sample Input
You have to echo the input numbers, followed by their GSC representations include all extra symbols, as shown below):<br>
 10 = 101 GSC <br> 2 = 1- GSC <br> -17 =  -1-0- GSC <br> 42 = 1---0 GSC<br> 1024 = 111-0-1 GSC<br>
